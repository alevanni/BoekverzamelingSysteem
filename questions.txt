- where should storeModuleFactory be?
- should all the index files be ts?
- tsconfig json is complaining
- should the state be an array?
- i suppose i still have to create the routes one by one
- should i put the delete and edit buttons also in the book page?
- should i make an overview of the books depending of the authors?
- why some events can be written like this @book-submit instead of the real name?
