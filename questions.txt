- should i put the delete and edit buttons also in the book page?
- it does not capitalize the first letter in the book overview, why??
- should i make an overview of the books depending of the authors?
- why some events can be written like this @book-submit instead of the real name??
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- if I put fetch authors in the form, it gives me errors from editbok but not from createbook. it adds part of the url to the request url. Why?


1) the pages for authors and reviews should stay in another domain? With another store?
2) when i create a new book, should i be able only select existing authors?
3) i had to add a line into the tsconfig.json. How much of what happens there do I have to know?
4) how much of the bash commands i used to create a new project do i have to know?
