- if I put fetch authors in the for, it gives me errors from editbok but not from vreatebook. it adds part of the url to the request url. Why?


1) the pages for authors and reviews should stay in another domain? With another store?
2) when i create a new book, should i be able only select existing authors?
3) i had to add a line into the tsconfig.json. How much of what happens there do I have to know?
4) how much of the bash commands i used to create a new project do i have to know?
